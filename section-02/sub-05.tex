\begin{majorEx} % 2.D
  Reformulate the axioms of topological structure using the words open
  set wherever possible.

Let $X$ be a set. Let $\omega$ be a collection of its subsets such that;
(1) the union of any collection of open sets is an open set
(2) the intersection of any finite collection of open sets is open
(3) the empty set $\emptyset$ and the whole set $X$ are open
