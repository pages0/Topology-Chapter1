\subsection{Using New Words: Points, Open Sets, Closed Sets}
\begin{majorEx} % 2.D
  Reformulate the axioms of topological structure using the words open
  set wherever possible.
\end{majorEx}

\begin{proof}[Answer]
    Let $X$ be a set. Let $\Omega$ be a collection of sets (called
    \emph{open sets}) such that:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the union of any collection of open sets is open;
        \item the intersection of any finite collection of open sets is open;
        \item the empty set $\emptyset$ and the whole $X$ are open.
    \end{enumerate}
    Then $(X, \Omega)$ is a topological space.
\end{proof}
