\subsection{Cantor Set}

\begin{majorEx}
    Find a geometric description of $K$.

    Prove that
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $K$ is contained in $[0,1]$,
        \item $K$ does not meet $(1/3, 2/3)$,
        \item $K$ does not meet $\left( \frac{3s+1}{3^k}, \frac{3s+2}{3^k}
            \right)$ for any integers $k$ and $s$.
    \end{enumerate}

    Present $K$ as $[0,1]$ with an infinite family of open intervals removed.

    Try to sketch $K$.
\end{majorEx}

\begin{majorEx}
Prove that $K$ is a closed set in the real line.
\end{majorEx}

\begin{proof}
We will take the complement of the Cantor set $(\{\Sigma_{k=1}^\infty a_k/3^k | a_k \in {0, 2}\})^c$ and label it $C^c$. In the construction of the
Cantor set, we know that $(\{\Sigma_{k=1}^n a_k/3^k | a_k \in {0, 2}\})^c$ $(n \in \RR)$ is a open set, and the addition of $(\{\Sigma_{k=1}^{n+1} a_k/3^k | a_k \in {0, 2}\})^c$ which is also open, is the intersection of two open sets, and will still result in a open set. Thus., $(\{\Sigma_{k=1}^\infty a_k/3^k | a_k \in {0, 2}\})^c$ is a intersection of open sets, and it is still a open set. By definition $\{\Sigma_{k=1}^\infty a_k/3^k | a_k \in {0, 2}\}$ which is the Cantor Set, is closed.
\end{proof}
