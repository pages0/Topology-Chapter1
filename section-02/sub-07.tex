\subsection{Properties of Closed Sets}

\begin{majorEx}
    Prove that:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the intersection of any collection of closed sets is closed;
        \item the union of any finite number of closed sets is closed;
        \item the empty set and the whole space (i.e., the underlying set of the
            topological structure) are closed.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{majorEx}

\begin{proof}
    Define $f : \mathcal{P}(X) \to \mathcal{P}(X)$ by $f(S) = X \setminus S$.
    This function will be used throughout the proof.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Let $K \subset \mathcal{P}(X)$ be an arbitrary collection of
            closed sets of $X$. Notice that for all $C \in K$, $X \setminus C$
            is open, so $f(K) \subseteq \Omega$. We have, then, that
            \[
                \bigcap_{C \in K} C = \bigcap_{E \in f(K)} X \setminus E.
            \]
            By De Morgan's law (2.E.3), we have
            \[
                \bigcap_{E \in f(K)} X \setminus E = X \setminus
                \bigcup_{E \in f(K)} E.
            \]
            As the arbitrary union of open sets is open, there is some $O \in
            \Omega$ such that
            \[
                \bigcup_{E \in f(K)} E = O.
            \]
            Thus,
            \[
                \bigcap_{C \in K} C = X \setminus O,
            \]
            which is therefore closed.
        \item Let $K \subset \mathcal{P}(X)$ be an arbitrary finite collection
            of closed sets of $X$. Notice that for all $C \in K$, $X \setminus
            C$ is open, so $f(K) \subseteq \Omega$. We have, then, that
            \[
                \bigcup_{C \in K} C = \bigcap_{E \in f(K)} X \setminus E.
            \]
            By De Morgan's law (2.E.4), we have
            \[
                \bigcup_{E \in f(K)} X \setminus E = X \setminus \bigcap_{E \in
                f(K)} E.
            \]
            As the finite intersection of open sets is open, there is some $O
            \in \Omega$ such that
            \[
                \bigcap_{E \in f(K)} E = O.
            \]
            Thus,
            \[
                \bigcup_{C \in K} C = X \setminus O,
            \]
            which is therefore closed.
        \item Since $X \in \Omega$ by Axiom 3, $X$ is open; thus, $X \setminus X
            = \emptyset$ is closed. Similarly, since $\emptyset \in \Omega$, $X
            \setminus \emptyset = X$ is closed.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
