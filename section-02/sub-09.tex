\subsection{Characterization of Topology in Terms of Closed Sets}

\begin{minorEx}
    Suppose a collection $\mathcal{F}$ of subsets of $X$ satisfies the
    followings conditions:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the intersection of any family of sets from $\mathcal{F}$ belongs
            to $\mathcal{F}$;
        \item the union of any finite number sets from $\mathcal{F}$ belongs to
            $\mathcal{F}$;
        \item $\emptyset$ and $X$ belongs to $\mathcal{F}$.
    \end{enumerate}
    Prove that then $\mathcal{F}$ is the set of all closed sets of a topological
    structure (which one?).
\end{minorEx}

\begin{proof}
    We show that with $\Omega = \mathcal{P}(X) \setminus \mathcal{F}$,
    $\mathcal{F}$ is the set of all closed sets of $(X, \Omega)$.  To do so, we
    will show that $(X, \Omega)$ is, in fact, a topological structure. As a
    consequence, we shall see that our desired result falls out of this
    investigation.

    Let $\Omega' \subseteq \Omega$ be arbitrary, and consider
    \[
        U = \bigcup_{S \in \Omega'} S.
    \]
    Now, since $S \in \Omega' \subseteq \Omega$, there exists some $K \in
    \mathcal{F}$ such that $S = X \setminus K$. If $\mathcal{F}' \subseteq
    \mathcal{F}$ is the collection which corresponds to $\Omega'$ through
    the complement in this way, we may thus write using De Morgan's laws
    \begin{align*}
        \bigcup_{S \in \Omega'} S &= \bigcup_{K \in \mathcal{F}'} X \setminus K
        \\
        &= X \setminus \bigcap_{K \in \mathcal{F}'} K \\
        &= X \setminus C,
    \end{align*}
    where $C \in \mathcal{F}$, using property (1). Hence, we have $U = X
    \setminus C$, so $U \in \Omega$.

    Let $\Omega' \subseteq \Omega$ be an arbitrary finite collection of sets,
    and consider 
    \[
        U = \bigcap_{S \in \Omega'} S.
    \]
    Now, since $S \in \Omega' \subseteq \Omega$, there exists some $K \in
    \mathcal{F}$ such that $S = X \setminus K$. If $\mathcal{F}' \subseteq
    \mathcal{F}$ is the (finite) collection which corresponds to $\Omega'$
    through the complement in this way, we may thus write using De Morgan's laws
    \begin{align*}
        \bigcap_{S \in \Omega'} S &= \bigcap_{K \in \mathcal{F}'} X \setminus K
        \\
        &= X \setminus \bigcup_{K \in \mathcal{F}'} K \\
        &= X \setminus C,
    \end{align*}
    where $C \in \mathcal{F}$, using property (2). Hence, we have $U = X
    \setminus C$, so $U \in \Omega$.

    Finally, note that $X = X \setminus \emptyset$, so $X \in \Omega$;
    similarly, $\emptyset \in \Omega$. Hence, $(X, \Omega)$ satisfies the
    topological axioms. As a consequence, $\mathcal{F}$ characterizes the closed
    sets of this topological space.

\begin{minorEx}
    List all collections of subsets of a three-element set such that there are
    topologies where these collections are complete sets of closed sets.
\end{minorEx}
\begin{proof}[Answer]
- ${\emptyset, {a, b, c}} meets the conditions in 2.13 (this is the set of closed sets in the discrete topology)$
- $\{\emptyset, \{a, b, c\}, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{c\}, \{a, b\}, \{b, c\}, \{a, c\}\}$ meets the conditions in 2.13 (this is the set of closed sets in the indiscrete topology)
- $\{\emptyset, \{a, b, c\}, \{a\}$ meets the conditions in 2.13, and so do other sets that are the same up to relabelling
- ${\emptyset, {a, b, c}, {a}, {b}, {a, b}}$ meets the conditions in 2.13, and so do other sets that are the same up to relabelling
\end{proof}
