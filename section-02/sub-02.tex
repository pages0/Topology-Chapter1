\begin{majorEx}
    Check that the discrete topological space is a topological space, i.e., all
    axioms of topological structure hold true.
\end{majorEx}

\begin{majorEx}
    The indiscrete topological space is a topological structure, is it not?
\end{majorEx}

\begin{proof}
    We show that the indiscrete topology $\Omega_I = \set{X, \emptyset}$ is
    indeed a topological structure. We see immediately that $X \in \Omega_I$ and
    $\emptyset \in \Omega_I$, so Axiom 3 is satisfied.

    To see that $\Omega_I$ is closed under arbitrary unions, let $\Omega_I'
    \subseteq \Omega_I$ be arbitrary. Then since $A \cup A = A$ and since 
    \[
        \bigcup_{A \in \Omega_I'} A
    \]
\end{proof}

\begin{minorEx}
    Let $X$ be the ray $[0, +\infty)$, and let $\Omega$ consist of $\emptyset$, %]
    $X$, and all rays $(a, +\infty)$ with $a \geq 0$. Prove that $\Omega$ is
    a topological space.
\end{minorEx}

\begin{minorEx}
    Let $X$ be a plane. Let $\Sigma$ consist of $\emptyset$, $X$, and all open
    disks centered at the origin. Is $\Sigma$ a topological structure?
\end{minorEx}

\begin{proof}[Answer---NEEDS FLESHING OUT]
    Yes. We see immediately that Axiom 3 is satisfied, since $\emptyset, X \in
    \Sigma$. In general, we will represent $D_r$ to indicate the open disk of
    radius $r > 0$ centered at the origin.

    To see that Axiom 1 holds, let $\Sigma' \subseteq \Sigma$ be arbitrary. To
    proceed, we observe that $D_r \subseteq D_{r'}$ whenever $r \leq r'$ (and
    equality holding exactly when $r = r'$). Let $f : \Sigma' \to \RR$ be
    defined by $f(D_r) = r$, and consider $f(\Sigma')$. Either $f(\Sigma')$ is
    bounded above, or it is unbounded. If it is bounded above, we have
    \[
        s = \sup f(\Sigma').
    \]
    In this case,
    \[
        \bigcup_{D_r \in \Sigma'} D_r = D_s \in \Sigma.
    \]
    Otherwise,
    \[
        \bigcup_{D_r \in \Sigma'} D_r = X \in \Sigma.
    \]
    In both cases, we see that the unions are elements of $\Sigma$.

    To see that Axiom 2 holds, let $\Sigma' \subseteq \Sigma$ be an arbitrary
    finite subset of $\Sigma$, and consider
    \[
        \bigcap_{D_r \in \Sigma'} D_r.
    \]
    Now, since $D_r \subseteq D_{r'}$ whenever $r \leq r'$, we have that $D_r
    \cap D_{r'} = D_r$ whenever $ r \leq r'$. In this case, $f(\Sigma')$ is
    finite, so by taking
    \[
        m = \min(f(\Sigma')),
    \]
    we have that
    \[
        \bigcap_{D_r \in \Sigma'} D_r = D_m.
    \]
\end{proof}

\begin{minorEx}
    Let $X$ consist of four elements: $X = \set{a, b, c, d}$. Which of the
    following collections of its subsets are topological structures in $X$,
    i.e., satisfy the axioms of topological structure:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\emptyset, X, \set{a}, \set{b}, \set{a,c} \set{a,b,c},
            \set{a,b}$;
        \item $\emptyset, X, \set{a}, \set{b}, \set{a,b} \set{b,d}$;
        \item $\emptyset, X, \set{a,c,d}, \set{b,c,d}$?
    \end{enumerate}
