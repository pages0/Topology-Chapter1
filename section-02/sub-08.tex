\begin{majorEx} %2.H
Is a closed segment $[a, b]$ closed in \mathds{R}?
Yes, it is. The complement of a closed segment $[a, b]$ is the union of the open sets $\{x | x < a\}$ and $\{x | x > b\}$, and so the closed segment is closed by the definition of a closed set and the standard topology on \mathds{R}.

\begin{minorEx} %2.11
  Prove that the half-open interval $[0,1)$  is neither open nor
  closed, but is both a union of closed sets and an instersection of
  open sets.
