\begin{minorEx}%4.8
Find $D_1(a)$, $D_(1/2)(a)$, and $S_(1/2)(a)$ in the space of 4.A.
\end{minorEx}
\begin{proof}[Answer]
For a set $X$ with the metric described in 4.A, $D_1(a)$ is the entire set $X$, $D_(1/2)(a)$ is a singleton with just the element $a$, and $S_(1/2)(a)$ is the emptyset.
\end{proof}
