\subsection{Equivalent Metrics}

\begin{minorEx}
    Are the metrics of 4.C, 4.1, and 4.2 equivalent?
\end{minorEx}

\begin{minorEx}
    Prove that two metrics $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ in $X$ are equivalent if there
    are numbers $c, C > 0$ such that
    \[
        c \rho_1(x,y) \leq \rho_2(x,y) \leq C \rho_1(x,y)
    \]
    for any $x, y \in X$.
\end{minorEx}

\begin{minorEx}
    Generally speaking, the converse is not true.
\end{minorEx}

\begin{minorEx}
    [Riddle]
    Hence the condition of equivalence of metrics formulated in Problem 4.27 can
    be weakened. How?
\end{minorEx}

\begin{minorEx}
    The metrics $\rho^{(p)}$ in $\RR^n$ defined right before Problem 4.3 are
    equivalent.
\end{minorEx}

\begin{minorEx}
    Prove that the following two metrics $\rho_1$ and $\rho_c$ in the set of all
    continuous functions $[0,1] \to \RR$ are not equivalent:
    \[
        \rho_1(f,g) = \int_{0}^{1} \abs{f(x) - g(x)} \ dx, \qquad
        \rho_c(f,g) = \max_{x \in [0,1]} \abs{f(x) - g(x)}.
    \]
    Is it true that one of the topological structures generated by them is finer
    than the other one?
\end{minorEx}
