\subsection{Subspaces of a Metric Space}
\begin{majorEx}%4.D
Check that $D^1$ is the segment $[-1, 1]$, $D^2$ is a plane disk, $S^0$ the pair of points ${-1, 1}$, $S^1$ is a circle, $S^2$ is a sphere, and $D^3$ is a ball
\end{majorEx}
\begin{proof}[Answer]
$D^1$ is, by definition, the set of values $x \in mathds{R}$ for which $\rho (x, 0) \leq 1$. In $\mathds{R}$, this is the set of values $[-1, 1]$ for the Euclidean metric.
$D^2$ is, by definition, the set of values $x \in \mathds{R}^2$ for which $\rho (x, (0, 0)) \leq 1$. In $\mathds{R}^2$, this is a disk - we are assured it is closed by the non-strict inequality - centered around (0, 0).
$S^0$ is, by definition, the set of values $x \in \mathds{R}$ for which $\rho (x, 0) = 1$. In $\mathds{R}$, this is exactly the set of values with an absolute value of 1, i.e. ${1, -1}$.
$S^1$ is, by definition, the set of values $x \in mathds{R}^2$ for which $\rho (x, (0, 0)) = 1$. In $\mathds{R}^2$, this is the set of values on the exterior of $D^2$, i.e. a sphere centered around (0,0) with radius 1.
$D^3$ is, by definition, the set of values $x \in mathds{R}^2$ for which $\rho (x, (0, 0, 0)) \leq 1$. In $\mathds{R}^3$ this takes the shape of a closed ball, because of the way that $rho (x, (0, 0, 0))$ scales sublinearly with each component of x.
