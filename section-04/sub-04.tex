\subsection{Subspaces of a Metric Space}


\begin{majorEx}%4.E
  Prove that for any points $x$ and $a$ of any metric space and any $r
  > \rho(a,x)$ we have

  $$B_{r-\rho(a,x)}(x) \subset B_r(a) \text{  and  }
  D_{r-\rho(a,x)}(x) \subset D_r(a)$$
\end{majorEx}

\begin{proof}
  Let $X$ be an arbitrary metric space, and let $a,x\in X$ be
  arbitrary such that $r
  > \rho(a,x)$ for some $r\in \RR$.  We will first show that 
  $B_{r-\rho(a,x)}(x) \subset B_r(a)$ . Let $b \in B_{r-\rho(a,x)}(x)$
  be arbitrary. Because $b \in B_{r-\rho(a,x)}(x)$, we know that
  $\rho(b,x) < r- \rho(a,x)$, and thus   $\rho(b,x) + \rho(a,x)<
  r$. We now can see by properties of a metric, that $\rho(b,a)<r$,
  and thus by definition of $B_r(a)$, we know that $b \in B_r(a)$. As
  $b$ was arbitrary, we know that $B_{r-\rho(a,x)}(x) \subset B_r(a)$.

  We will now show that $D_{r-\rho(a,x)}(x) \subset D_r(a)$. Let $d 
  \in D_{r-\rho(a,x)}(x)$ be arbitrary. Because $d \in D_{r-\rho(a,x)}(x)$, we know that
  $\rho(d,x) \leq r- \rho(a,x)$, and thus   $\rho(d,x) + \rho(a,x)<
  r$. We now can see by properties of a metric, that $\rho(d,a)<r$,
  and thus by definition of $D_r(a)$, we know that $d \in D_r(a)$. As
  $d$ was arbitrary, we know that $D_{r-\rho(a,x)}(x) \subset
  D_r(a)$. As we have proven both claims, we know that the statement holds.
