\subsection{Segments (What Is Between)}

\begin{minorEx}
    Prove that the segment with endpoints $a,b \in \RR^n$ can be described as 
    \[
        \set{x \in \RR^n : \rho(a,x) + \rho(x,b) = \rho(a, b)},
    \]
    where $\rho$ is the Euclidean metric.
\end{minorEx}

\begin{minorEx}
    How does the set defined as in Problem 4.12 look if $\rho$ is the metric
    defined in Problems 4.1 or 4.2? (Consider the case where $n = 2$ if it seems
    to be easier.)
\end{minorEx}
