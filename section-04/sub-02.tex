  Prove that $\rho^{p}$ is a metric for any $p \geq 1$, where

$$\rho^{(p)} : (x,y) \mapsto (\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - y_i|^p)^{1/p} \text{,   }p\geq 1$$

and then show the Holder Inequality. 

Let $x_1,...,x_n,y_1,...,y_n \geq 0$, let $p,q >0$,
and let $1/p + 1/q =1$. Prove that
$$\sum_{i=1}^n x_iy_i \leq (\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^p)^{1/p} (\sum_{i=1}^ny_i^q)^{1/q}$$
\end{minorEx}

\begin{proof}
  We will first show that if $\rho^{(p)}(x,y)=0$ then $x=y$. Let $x,y
  \in \RR^n$ be arbitrary, such that $\rho^{(p)}(x,y)=0$. We then have that 
  $$(\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - y_i|^p)^{1/p} =0$$
  and thus
  $$\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - y_i|^p =0$$
  As $|x_i - y_i|^p$ is never negative for any $x_i,y_i$, we thus see
  that for every $i$
  $$|x_i - y_i|^p =0$$ and the exponent function is injective, we know
  that $|x_i - y_i|=0$, and thus $x_i=y_i$ for all $i$, and thus by
  definition of equality for $\RR^n$, we have $x=y$. As $x,y$ were
  arbitrary, we know have that  if $\rho^{(p)}(x,y)=0$ then $x=y$.

  We also see by the definition of equality on $\RR^n$, that if for
  some $x,y\in \RR^n$ $x=y$, that for
  every $i$, $x_i=y_i$, and thus $|x_i-y_i|=0$ for every $i$, and thus
  $(\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - y_i|^p)^{1/p}=0$  and thus
  $\rho^{(p)}(x,y)=0$. We thus have that as $x,y$ were arbitrary, that
  if $x=y$, then $\rho^{(p)}(x,y)=0$, and thus $\rho^{(p)}(x,y)=0$ iff
  $x=y$.

  We will now show that for any $x,y\in \RR^n$ that
  $\rho(x,y)=\rho(y,x)$. Let $x,y\in \RR^n$ be arbitrary.
  We see that 
  $$\rho(x,y) = 
  (\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - y_i|^p)^{1/p}= 
  (\sum_{i=1}^n |y_i - x_i|^p)^{1/p}= 
  \rho(x,y)$$
  and as $x,y$ were arbitray, we have that 
   for any $x,y\in \RR^n$ that
  $\rho(x,y)=\rho(y,x)$.

  We now will show that $\rho(x,y) \leq \rho(x,z) + \rho(z,y)$ for any
  $x,y,z$. Let $x,y,z \in \RR^n$ be arbitrary. We see that 
  $$\rho(x,y)= 
  (\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - y_i|^p)^{1/p}=$$
