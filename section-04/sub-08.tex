\subsection{Norms and Normed Spaces}

\begin{minorEx}%4.15
    Prove that if $x \to \norm{x}$ is a norm, then
    \[
        \rho : X \times X \to \RR_+ : (x,y) \mapsto \norm{x - y}
    \]
\end{minorEx}

\begin{proof}
  We will first show that $\rho(x,y) =0$ if and only if $x=y$. We see
  that as $\rho(x,y)= \norm{x-y}$, that $\rho(x,y)=0$ if and only if
  $x-y=0$, and thus if $x=y$. We thus have that $\rho(x,y) =0$
  if and only if $x=y$.
\end{proof}

\begin{minorEx}
    Look through the problems of this section and figure out which of the metric
    spaces involved are, in fact, normed vector spaces.
\end{minorEx}

\begin{minorEx}
    Prove that every ball in a normed space is a convex set symmetric with
    respect to the center of the ball.
\end{minorEx}

\begin{minorEx}
    Prove that every convex closed bounded set in $\RR^n$ that has a center of
    symmetry and is not contained in any affine space except $\RR^n$ itself is a
    unit ball with respect to a certain norm, which is uniquely determined by
    this ball.
