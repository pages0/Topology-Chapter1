\subsection{Definition and First Examples}

\begin{majorEx}%4.A
  Prove that the function
  \begin{center}
  $\rho : X \times X \rightarrow \RR_+ : (x,y) \mapsto $
  \[ \begin{cases} 
    0 & \text{if } x=y \\
    1 & \text{if } x \neq y 
  \end{cases}
  \]
\end{center}
\end{majorEx}
is a metric for any set $X$
\begin{proof}
   We first see that as if $x=y$, then $\rho(x,y)$, and if $x\neq y$, that $\rho(x,y)=1\neq 0$, that we have that the first property of metrics holds.

   We now see that as $x=y$ implies $y=x$, that if $x=y$, 
   $\rho(x,y)=\rho(y,x)=0$, and if $x\neq y$, $\rho(x,y)=\rho(y,x)=1$, and thus the 
   second property of metrics holds.

   Finally, we have that as equality is a equivalence relation, that if $x=y$ , and $y=z$, 
   that $x=z$, and thus $\rho(x,y) = \rho(x,z)+ \rho(z,y)=0$, and that otherwise, as $\rho(x,y)\geq 0$ for any $x,y$, we see that if $x\neq y$, that $\rho(x,y) \leq \rho(x,z)+ \rho(z,y)$   
\end{proof}
