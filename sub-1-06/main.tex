				\begin{majorEx}%1.A
					Let a set $ A $ have $a$ elements, and let a set $B$ have $b$ elements. Prove that if $A \subset B $, then $a\leq b$.
				\end{majorEx}
				\begin{proof}
					Suppose  $ A $ is a set made up of $a$ elements, and $B$ is a set made up of $b$ elements. Suppose $a > b$; then there must be some element $x \in A$ that satisfies $x \notin B$. This implies that $A \not\subset B$, as $x$ is not a member of $B$. By the contrapositive, we obtain the desired result.
				\end{proof}
