\subsection{Definition of Base}
\begin{minorEx}[Riddle]%3.4
What topological structures have exactly one base?
\end{minorEx}
The first thing to note is that given a base $\Sigma$ of a topology $\Omega$, if there exists an open set $o$ in $\Omega$ that is not in $\Sigma$, there exists another base $\Sigma \cup o$. SO the only topologies for which there are a single base are those for which the only base is all of $\Omega$. We know the set $X$ must be the union of sets in $\Omega$, so there must be no collection of sets in $\Omega$, the union of which is $X$, except the entire set. This is the case when, for all sets $a \in \Omega$, there does not exist some collection of sets $C$ in $\Omega$ \ $a$ for which $a \subset C$.
