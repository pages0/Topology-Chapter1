Can two distinct topological structures have the same base?
\end{minorEx}

We claim that two distinct topological structures must have different bases.

\begin{proof}
Assume that two different topological structure $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ have the same base $S_b$. Every subset in $\Omega_1$ can be expressed as unions of elements in $S_b$ which will be in $\Omega_2$ by definition of topological structure. So we reach a conclusion that $\Omega_1$ is the same as $\Omega_2$ since they contain the same elements, a contradiction.

  Prove that any base of the canonical topology on $\RR$ can be decreased
\end{minorEx}
\begin{proof}
  Let $\Sigma$ be a base of the canonical topology on $\RR$. Let $A$ be an element of 
  $\Sigma$. We see that $A$ is an open set, and thus an aritrary union of open intervals. 
\end{proof}

What topological structures have exactly one base?
\end{minorEx}
The first thing to note is that given a base $\Sigma$ of a topology $\Omega$, if there exists an open set $o$ in $\Omega$ that is not in $\Sigma$, there exists another base $\Sigma \cup o$. SO the only topologies for which there are a single base are those for which the only base is all of $\Omega$. We know the set $X$ must be the union of sets in $\Omega$, so there must be no collection of sets in $\Omega$, the union of which is $X$, except the entire set. This is the case when, for all sets $a \in \Omega$, there does not exist some collection of sets $C$ in $\Omega$ \ $a$ for which $a \subset C$.
