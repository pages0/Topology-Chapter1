\subsection{Topology for a Subset of a Space}

\begin{majorEx}%5.A
The collection $\Omega_a$ is a topological structure in $A$.
\end{majorEx}
\begin{proof}
  We first see that as $X\in \Omega$, that $A\cap X \in \Omega_a$
\end{proof}

\begin{majorEx}%5.B
The canonical topology on $\RR^1$ coincides with the topology induced on $\RR^1$ as a subspace of $\RR^2$.
\end{majorEx}
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\begin{minorEx}[Riddle]%5.1
How to construct a base for at topology induced on $A$ by using a base for the topology on $X$.
\end{minorEx}

\begin{minorEx}%5.2
Describe the topological structures induced
(1) on the set $\NN$ of positive integers by the topology of the real line:
(2) on $\NN$ by the topology of the arrow
(3) on the two-element set {1, 2} by the topology of $\RR_T$
(4) on the same set by the topology of the arrow
\end{minorEx}

\begin{minorEx}%5.3
Is the half open interval $[0, 1)$ open in the segment $[0, 2]$, regarded as a subspace of the real line?
\end{minorEx}

\begin{majorEx}%5.C
A set $F$ is closed in a subspace $A \subset X$ iff $F$ is the intersection of $A$ and a closed subset of $X$.
\end{majorEx}
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\begin{minorEx}%5.4
If a subset of a subspace is open (respectively, closed) in the ambient space, then it also open (respectively, closed) in the subspace.
