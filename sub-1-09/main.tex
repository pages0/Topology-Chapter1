            $x \in A$ if and only if $\{x\} \subset A$.
            \end{majorEx}

\begin{proof} We will first show that if $\{x\} \subset A$, then $x \in A$. We can see that as $\{x\}$ is a set described by listing all of its elements, that $x \in \{x\}$. We also see that
as $\{x\} \subset A$, that all of the elements of $\{x\}$ are also elements of $A$, and thus $x \in A$. We thus know that if $\{x\} \subset A$, then $x \in A$.

We will now show that if $x \in A$, then $\{x\} \subset A$. We can see that as $\{x\}$ is a set described by listing all of its elements, that $x$ is the only element in $\{x\}$.
We also see that as $x \in A$, that all elements of $\{ x\}$ belong to $A$, and thus $\{x\} \subset A$. We now can see that $x \in A$ if and only if $\{x\} \subset A$.
